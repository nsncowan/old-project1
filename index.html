  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Originally from <strong>Boston, Massachusetts,</strong> I moved to the west coast in 2013 with my (now) wife in 2013. Living in Seattle at first, I felt drawn to Portland with starting with my first visit. I moved to the west coast to become a chef, and spent the last decade honing my skills. When the pandemic hit, I reevaluated my priorities and my wife and I started a family. Now I'm excited to begin a new career as a web developer. I plan to take the energy and work ethic I learned in the kitchen, and apply it to my new venture!</p>
